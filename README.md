# 🔐 ASCON-AEAD128 for Secure V2V & Embedded Applications

This project implements the **ASCON-AEAD128** encryption algorithm in **Verilog**, tailored for use in systems like **Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication** and **resource-constrained embedded devices**.

The focus is on building a lightweight, secure, and fast encryption core — with future support for full encryption/decryption, hardware deployment, and latency optimization.
